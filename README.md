alberta-grizzly-bears
=====================

Grizzly bear zone delineations are based upon agreed upon grizzly bear core and secondary grizzly bear watershed units determined by Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, and the Boreal Grizzly bear range of the Chinchaga area. Grizzly bear watershed units are characterised as being either Core or Secondary grizzly bear habitat. Core Areas are areas of high habitat value (Resource Selection Function) and generally low mortality risk currently measured through Open Route Densities. Secondary Areas are areas of good habitat, reflecting the broader range of grizzly bears. All Core and Secondary areas within a grizzly bear population unit were merged producing Core and Secondary population units.
